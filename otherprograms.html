            	<p>Why not think of joining a small group of high schoolers for a 10 night visit to France. Three glorious days in Paris, and 7 in the idyllic countryside of lower Normandy. Visit the Loire Valley, D- Day beaches, loads of ch&acirc;teaux (medieval and Renaissance), cathedrals, Roman ruins, Renaissance art and architecture, museums, school, farm, shopping, and on and on. The 7 days in the countryside will be in a 300 year old, picturesque, renovated boarding school.</p>
            	<p>The cost is $1950 PLUS airfare, and this covers about everything: all accommodation (including three nights in Paris), all transportation within France; all meals (except Paris&hellip;to allow choice), all entrance fees into sites; and travel insurance.</p>
