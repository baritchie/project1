						My daughters, 16 and 18, had the trip of a lifetime with Summer School France...the amount of knowledge they gained through firsthand experience is so much greater than they could ever learn from books or a classroom!

				<blockquote>
					<p class="editable">
						Since that trip, I have been back to Europe seven times—and back to Paris three times. I am currently earning a PhD at a university in the UK through a distance study program, which requires regular travel to the university campus in Stratford-Upon-Avon, England.  I have travelled solo and have managed small groups.  Without that early experience travelling abroad without my parents, I doubt I would have had the courage to explore so much of the world later in life.<br>When parents today ask me if they should send their children to France with Live and Learn, I tell them exactly what my great-grandmother told me: You would be a fool not to.

				<blockquote>
					<p class="editable">
						The trip inspired me to take a three month trip to Europe when I was 19. It made me a Francophile for life. It ignited a passion for languages, economics, literature, history, and international politics. I genuinely believe that it shaped me in ways I can’t articulate. I continued to study French at UC Berkeley, and became more involved with the International Studies in law school at the University of Chicago
